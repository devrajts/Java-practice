2) Describe Transactions in sql with your own words.
A transaction is an entity generally a group of SQL statements, or a combination of statements
and stored procedure calls, which should be executed all or none.

for example if a transaction has 4 statements s1 to s4 and for instance, s4 throws some error may be due to incorrect
syntax or access or any functional issues, then the statements s1 to s3 would be rolled back and the database would
reach its original state as if no statement got executed.

there are four properties of mySQL transaction:
1) Atomicity.
2)Consistency.
3)Isolation.
4)Durability.
